-=- [ Dark Era ] -=-
I'll put Dark Obelisk as a early replacement to HSJ.

Black Market:
- The Phantom
- Dark Garden
- Dark Charger
- Dark Constellations
- The Star

The Phantom:
- The Phantom is a Dark Obelisk feature.
- On enable: Phantom rarely starts to grow.
- Cutting Phantom gives a temporary Cursed effect:
-- Grow Speed is always 100/s.
-- You only gain Phantom.

Dark Garden:
- Place Phantom into a 5x5 field of Garden.
- Grow Phantom with different Souls by Fertilizer. (must wait to grow)
- Souls boost Dark Garden (dependent on kind) and give more Phantom.

Star Frenzy [SNT1]:
- Star Frenzy starts per 10x Star Growth.
- Star Frenzy: Cut Grass for Solar Rays and Shards.
- Cutting reduces / adds lifespan. (higher eclipse = higher reduction)
- If lifespan reaches 0, Star Frenzy ends.
